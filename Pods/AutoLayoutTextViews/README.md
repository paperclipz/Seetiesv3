## AutoLayoutTextViews

`AutoLayoutTextViews` subclasses `UITextView` and adds placeholder text, auto resizing, and keyboard avoiding functionality.

`AutoLayoutTextViews` was inspired in part by Mouhcine El Amine's work on <a href="https://github.com/mouhcine/EAMTextView">EAMTextView</a> and by Matej Balantiƒç's work on <a href="https://github.com/MatejBalantic/MBAutoGrowingTextView">MBAutoGrowingTextView</a>.

### Installation with CocoaPods

The easiest way to add `AutoLayoutTextViews` to your project is using <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>. Simply add the following to your Podfile:

    pod 'AutoLayoutTextViews', '~> 1.0'

Then run `pod install` as you normally would.

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually include `AutoLayoutTextViews` in your project by doing the following:

1) Clone this repo locally onto your computer, or press `Download ZIP` to simply download the latest `master` commit.

2) Drag the `AutoLayoutTextViews` folder into your project, making sure `Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)` is checked.

### General Project Structure

`AutoLayoutTextViews` is architected as follows:

1) `ALPlaceholderTextView` subclasses `UITextView` and adds an optional `placeholder` property.

2) `ALAutoResizingTextView` subclasses `ALPlaceholderTextView`, which gives it a `placeholder` property, and adds "auto resizing" behavior- the text view will grow and shrink as the user types.

Note: when you create `layout constraints` (either in Interface Builder or in code), make sure that you set the `height` and/or `bottom` constraints to `greater than or equal`. See the `AutoLayoutTextViewsDemo` project for an example of how to do this using Interface Builder.

3) `ALKeyboardAvoidingTextView` also subclasses `ALPlaceholderTextView`, which gives it a `placeholder` property, and adds "keyboard avoiding" behavior- the text view's frame will shrink/expand as the keyboard will show/hide.

### How to Use

Simply use `ALPlaceholderTextView`, `ALAutoResizingTextView`, or `ALKeyboardAvoidingTextView` as a replacement for a `UITextView` where you the added functionality provided by one of these.

For example usage of each of these, see the `AutoLayoutTextViewsDemo` project within this repository.

Note: `AutoLayoutTextViewsDemo` uses CocoaPods to add `AutoLayoutTextViews` as a dependency. So, you will need to first run `pod install` in the `AutoLayoutTextViewsDemo` directory.
